_NumNepConverter_ is a simple python GUI application that converts Numbers to Nepali digits. 

**Motivation**
The purpose behind the building the application was to avoid the error that occurred while manually converting the numbers to nepali digits. At the time, i was working offline and was facing a lot error while preparing a quotations. 
So, i made this application that runs locally. This helped me to avoid the errors and finish my task efficiently.
